# Classification_of_Cancer_Tumors
About the Dataset:
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Attribute Information:
1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Classification of cancer tumors is an important task in medical research and diagnosis. There are various methods and approaches used for tumor classification, including:

Histopathological Classification: This approach involves examining tumor samples under a microscope to identify the type of cancer based on the appearance of cells and tissue structures.

Molecular Classification: This method involves analyzing the genetic and molecular characteristics of tumor cells. 
Techniques such as DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling, and molecular markers are used to classify tumors based on specific genetic alterations or biomarkers associated with different cancer types.

Imaging-based Classification: Imaging techniques such as MRI, CT scan, and PET scan can provide valuable information about the size, location, and characteristics of tumors. 
Radiologists analyze these images to classify tumors based on their appearance and behavior.

Clinical Classification: This approach takes into account various clinical factors such as patient demographics, medical history, symptoms, and laboratory test results to classify tumors into different stages or subtypes.

It's important to note that tumor classification methods may vary depending on the specific type of cancer and the available resources and expertise. 
Advances in technology, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, are also being explored to improve the accuracy and efficiency of tumor classification.
